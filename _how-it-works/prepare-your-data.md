### Select which identifier you will use to consistently identify each product 
  Examples: 
  - UPC
  - SKU
  

### Export the identifiers from each transaction
  Generate a comma-separated value file containing the identifiers (only the identifiers!) for each checkout transaction
  - Each transaction is represented as a line of comma-separated values
