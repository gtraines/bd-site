### Our mission

To present retailers with the *science* necessary to *effortlessly connect customers* with the merchandise that meets their individual needs and desires.

We strive to work in a modern way and use best practices on all our projects. Here's what that means to us:

  <li class="icon-list">
    <figure class="icon-list-image">{% include svg/icons/respect-icon.svg %}</figure>
    <div class="icon-list-text">
      <p class="p-bold">Respect for government workers</p>
      <p>Civil servants have tremendous knowledge about what it takes to achieve their agency’s mission. We help clear technical and governmental hurdles to better serve the public.</p>

  <li class="icon-list">
    <figure class="icon-list-image">{% include svg/icons/user-centered-icon.svg %}</figure>
    <div class="icon-list-text">
      <p class="p-bold">Human-centered design</p>
      <p>We listen to real users to understand their needs and build things that will be useful to them — without sacrificing technical or regulatory requirements.</p>

  </li>

  <li class="icon-list">
    <figure class="icon-list-image">{% include svg/icons/agile-icon.svg %}</figure>
    <div class="icon-list-text">
      <p class="p-bold">Agile methods</p>
      <p>We help you move faster and adopt new approaches that reduce risk on your projects. We pay careful attention to what succeeds, and use metrics and feedback to inform what we build.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="icon-list">
    <figure class="icon-list-image">{% include svg/icons/open-icon.svg %}</figure>
    <div class="icon-list-text">
      <p class="p-bold">Open technology</p>
      <p>Our projects are designed and built in public. That means open source, open data, and open APIs. Working transparently helps us develop faster, make better decisions, provide code for many others to reuse, and keep costs low.</p>
